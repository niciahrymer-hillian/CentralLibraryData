# Shhhh! CentralLibraryData

the place CentralLibrary gets its content from.

As a team, fork this repository to an Organization and submit the URL of your fork via the Student Portal. Each teammate will submit the **SAME URL.** 

There are things you _need to know_ and ask Instructors about. What are they? When can we schedule some dialog sessions so that you can get some ideas about what to study? 

Group Work requires that y'all think about plans, and priorities, and schedule some time to get to experts and senior devs to ask intelligent questions, and learn important topics. 

_What are they?_

## Project Overview

Build a series of pipelines that feed the content needed by a comprehensive Library Management System built by the Java group.

This is a Data project matched to the Java project [Central Library](https://github.com/ZCW-Summer25/CentralLibrary.git).

The Java group builds that project, Data, you get to wrangle the data in the datasets below into a form that you agree with Java on. They load it, we get cool software.

## Learning Objectives

- pipelines - for real
- data formats (csv, json)
- wrangling data into useful formats

## Need to Know

- pandas
- python data structures

### Content Datasets

and this is NOT public: https://zcw-students-projects.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/LMSDataForWeek3Project/LMS-DataStuff.zip

It contains the collected data for this project.
You need to get it from an instructor, we're not gonna store it in this github repo, it's too Big.

## The Pipeline Exercises


These are the conceptual sub-projects.
They will be useful in understanding how and what you need to do to provide Java with the data y'all need to make the project complete.

## Run Commands

Clean data into `cleaned_data/`:

```bash
python clean_data.py --trim-fields --validate-csv --write-reports
```

Run Java export pipeline using project data:

```bash
python export_java_class_data.py
```

Run Java export pipeline against sample data:

```bash
python export_java_class_data.py --sample --sample-group valid_records
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```
